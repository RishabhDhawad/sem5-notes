## Introduction to Computer Graphics

### What is Computer Graphics?
Computer graphics deals with generating images with the aid of computers. Today, computer graphics is a core technology in digital photography, film, video games, cell phone and computer displays, and many specialized applications. A great deal of specialized hardware and software has been developed, with the displays of most devices being driven by computer graphics hardware. It is a vast and recently developed area of computer science. The phrase was coined in 1960 by computer graphics researchers Verne Hudson and William Fetter of Boeing. It is often abbreviated as CG, or typically in the context of film as computer generated imagery (CGI). The non-artistic aspects of computer graphics are the subject of computer science research.

### Where Computer generated pictures are used?
1. User interfaces: It is now a well established fact that graphical interfaces provide an attractive and easy interaction between users and computers. The built-in graphics provided with user interfaces use visual control items such as buttons, menus, icons, scroll bar etc, which allows user to interact with computer only by mouse-click. Typing is necessary only to input text to be stored and manipulated.
2. Plotting of graphics and chart: In industry, business, government, and educational organizations, computer graphics is most commonly used to create 2D and 3D graphs of mathematical, physical and economic functions in form of histograms, bars and pie-charts. These graphs and charts are very useful for decision making.
3. Computer-aided drafting and design: the computer –aided drafting uses graphics to design components and systems electrical, mechanical, electromechanical and electronic devices such as automobile bodies, structures of building, airplane, ships, very large scale integrated chips, optical systems and computer networks.
4. Simulation and Animation: use of graphics in simulation makes mathematic models and mechanical systems more realistic and easy to study. The interactive graphics supported by animation software proved their use in production of animated movies
and cartoons films.
5. Art and Commerce: There is a lot of development in the tools provided by computer graphics. This allows user to create artistic pictures which express message and attract attentions. Such pictures are very useful in advertising.
6. Process Control: By the use of computer now it is possible to control various processes in the industry from a remote control room. In such cases, process systems and processing parameters are shown on the computer with graphic
symbols and identifications. This makes it easy for operator to monitor and control various processing parameters at a time.
7. Cartography: Computer graphics is also used to represent geographic maps, weather maps, oceanographic charts, counter maps, population density maps and so on.
8. Education and training: computer graphics can be used to generate models of physical aids. Models of physical systems, physiological systems, population trends,
or equipment, such as color –coded diagram can help trainees to understand the operation of the system.
9. Image processing: in computer graphics, a computer is used to create pictures. Image processing, on the other hands, applies techniques to modify or interpret existing picture such as photographs and scanned image. Image processing and computer graphics are typically combined in many applications such as to model and study physical functions, to design artificial limbs, and to plan and practice surgery. Image processing techniques are most commonly used for picture enhancements to analyze satellite photos, X-ray photography and so on.

Computer graphics is responsible for displaying art and image data effectively and meaningfully to the consumer. It is also used for processing image data received from the physical world, such as photo and video content. Computer graphics development has had a significant impact on many types of media and has revolutionized animation, movies, advertising, video games, in general.

CGI is used to produce images for many purposes including visual art, advertising, anatomical modeling, architectural design, engineering, television shows, video game art and film special effects,  as well as augmented  reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications.


### Advantages of Computer Graphics
1. A high quality graphics displays of personal computer provide one of the most natural means of communicating with a computer.
2. It has an ability to show moving pictures, and thus it is possible to produce animations with computer  graphics.
3. With computer graphics you can also control the animation by adjusting the speed, the portion of the total scene in view, the geometric relationship of the objects in the scene to one another, the amount of detail shown and so on.
4. The computer graphics also provides facility called update dynamics. With update dynamics it is possible to change the shape, color or other properties of the objects being viewed.
5. With the recent development of digital signal processing (DSP) and audio synthesis chip the interactive graphics can now provide audio feedback along with the graphical feedbacks to make the simulated environment even more realistic.

### Elements of Pictures created in Computer Graphics Graphics display devices

Images are typically created by devices such as cameras, mirrors, lenses, telescopes, microscopes, etc.

Digital images include both vector images and raster images, but raster images are more commonly used.

#### Pixel
In digital imaging, a pixel (or picture element[24]) is a single point in a raster image. Pixels are placed on a regular 2-dimensional grid, and are often represented using dots or squares. Each pixel is a sample of an original image, where more samples typically provide a more accurate representation of the original. The intensity of each pixel is variable; in color systems, each pixel has typically three components such as red, green, and blue.

#### Aspect Ratio
The aspect ratio of an image is the ratio of its width to its height, and is expressed with two numbers separated by a colon, such as 16:9, sixteen-to-nine. For the x:y aspect ratio, the image is x units wide and y units high. Common aspect ratios are 1.85:1 and 2.39:1 in cinematography, 4:3 and 16:9 in television photography, and 3:2 in still photography.

#### Resolution
Resolution. Resolution indicates the number of pixels that are displayed per inch for an image (or pixels per centimeter). Most computer monitors display at resolutions of 72 pixels per inch or 96 pixels per inch.

#### Display Processor
Display Processor is the interpreter or a hardware that converts display processor code into picture. The Display Processor converts the digital information from CPU to analog values. The main purpose of the Digital Processor is to free the CPU from most of the graphic chores. The Display Processor digitize a picture definitions given in an application program into a set of pixel intensity values for storage in the frame buffer. This digitization process is called Scan Conversion.
__Features of Display Processor:__
* Display processors includes functions such as generating various line styles, displaying color area and performing transformations and manipulations on display object.
* Display Processor was used before the GPU (Graphics Display Processor).
* Video Controller is the most widely used Display device that is based on CRT (Cathode Ray Tube).
* In addition with the system memory, Display Processor have a separate memory area.
